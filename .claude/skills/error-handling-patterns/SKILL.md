# Error Handling Patterns

Robust error handling for resilient apps.

## Use When
- Implementing error handling in features
- Designing error-resilient APIs
- Debugging production issues
- Retry & circuit breaker patterns
- Async/concurrent error handling
- Fault-tolerant distributed systems

## Process
1. Clarify goals, constraints, inputs
2. Apply best practices, validate outcomes
3. Provide actionable steps & verification
